#This is for an initial exploration of the field-level data Terry Kastens sent, February 2024. The
#main purpose is to explore the data, but an initial guiding goal I'm using just to have a goal is the 
#goal Terry listed in his accompanying writeup, namely (and not so precisely as of now), "should a corn
#crop be followed by another corn crop or else a long fallow period." Other goals also emerge.

#Import the basic, already pre-processed data from Terry, and do whatever basic organizing is needed,
#and the save in an R format

#Initial comparisons of cropping rotations and resulting yields. This was an initial, not wholly 
#statistically appropriate analysis, now superceded by subsequent analysis. But still some of the
#data produces stored by this code are needed in subsequent analyses.
